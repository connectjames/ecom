                        16.4 THE BUYER’S ATTENTION IS IN PARTICULAR DRAWN TO THE PROVISIONS OF CLAUSE 16.5<br>
                        16.5 Subject to clause 16.3:<br>
                        16.5.1 to the extent that the Company is insured for such a claim, the Company’s total public liability arising in connection with the performance or contemplated performance of the Products and/or Services under the Agreement shall be limited to such sum as it receives from its insurers in connection with that claim or the sum of £10,000,000 whichever shall be the lesser;<br>
                        16.5.2 to the extent that the Company is insured for such a claim, the Company’s total product liability arising in connection with the performance or contemplated performance of the Products and/or Services under the Agreement shall be limited to such sum as it receives from its insurers in connection with that claim or the sum of £10,000,000 whichever shall be the lesser;<br>
                        16.5.3 except as provided in clauses 16.5.1 and 16.5.2, the Company’s total liability arising in connection with the performance or contemplated performance of the Products and/or Services under the Agreement shall be limited to twice the value of the Products and/or Services;<br>
                        16.5.4 for the avoidance of doubt there shall be included in the amounts set out in clauses 16.5.1, 16.5.2 and 16.5.3 all legal and other professional fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Buyer in establishing and presenting any claim against the Company; and<br>
                        16.5.5 the Company shall not be liable to the Buyer for any indirect or consequential loss or damage (whether for loss of profit, loss of business, depletion of goodwill or otherwise), or other claims for consequential compensation whatsoever (howsoever caused) which arise out of or in connection with the Agreement.<br>
                        16.6 The price for the Products and/or Services is determined on the basis of the exclusions from, and limitations of, liability contained in these Terms and Conditions. The Buyer expressly agrees that these exclusions and liabilities are reasonable because of (amongst other matters) the likelihood that the amount of damages awardable to the Buyer for a breach by the Company of these Terms and Conditions may otherwise be disproportionately greater than the price for the Products and/or Services. The Company is willing to discuss with the Buyer different exclusions from, and limitations of, liability provided the Buyer is willing to discuss a commensurately higher price for the Products and/or Services.<br>
                        16.7 In the event that the Buyer is a consumer, the Buyer’s statutory rights are not adversely affected by these Terms and Conditions.</p>

                        19.5 Any waiver by the Company of any breach of, or any default under, any provision of the Agreement by the Buyer will not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach or default and will in no way affect the other terms of the Agreement.<br>
